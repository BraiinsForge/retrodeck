# Third-party software and assets

Retro Deck is built on free software. The dashboard's `(c)` screen reads the
authoritative project, role, and SPDX-style license summary from
[`deploy/menu/credits.tsv`](deploy/menu/credits.tsv).

The deployer installs the corresponding upstream notices and license texts at
`/mnt/data/nes-deck/licenses`. Runtime packages carry their own notices, while
the shared static libraries, Go toolchain, Nixpkgs source, and CC0 asset
provenance are collected by `nix/runtime-licenses.nix`. The separately pinned
ECL runtime carries ECL, ASDF/UIOP, Boehm GC, libatomic_ops, GMP, and glibc
notices from the exact source archives used in its build.

Source identity is reproducible from these files:

- `flake.lock` pins the emulator cores and Nixpkgs.
- `flake.nix` names every native runtime and its linked libraries.
- `nix/ecl-arm-static.nix` pins the independent ECL build environment.
- `chiptunes/README.md` and `deploy/menu/ASSETS.md` record the included CC0
  music and settings icons.

Owner-supplied ROMs are private data. They are not third-party project
dependencies and are not relicensed by this repository.
