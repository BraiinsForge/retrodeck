# RetroDeck migration baseline

This document records the implementation that the Rust and Common Lisp
migration must replace. The running product remains authoritative whenever this
summary and observed behavior disagree.

## Contract

- Preserve the native Wayland product one-to-one from the user's perspective.
- Preserve layout, colors, labels, borders, fonts, animation, timing, sounds,
  touch, keyboard, controller input, launch behavior, saves, and return flows.
- Keep external emulators and established dependencies. Replace only
  first-party C, C++, and Go code.
- Load editable Common Lisp from the device at startup and make Lisp the
  orchestrator and policy owner.
- Keep Rust limited to native mechanisms such as Wayland, buffers, input,
  non-blocking audio, process control, and narrow operating-system interfaces.
- Prefer maintained libraries and small adapters over reimplementation.
- Avoid speculative services, frameworks, hardening, and test volume.
- Reduce total Rust and Common Lisp source below the current measured baseline.

## Physical source-line budget

The baseline uses physical lines, including comments and blank lines. It
excludes shell, protocol XML, generated files, assets, and vendored third-party
code.

| Area | Lines |
| --- | ---: |
| `src/` C and C++ implementations and headers | 13,174 |
| `ops/deck-menu/` C++ screenshot tools | 305 |
| Production Go uploader | 2,016 |
| Existing Common Lisp catalog compiler | 414 |
| **Production and tool baseline** | **15,909** |
| First-party C and C++ tests | 2,144 |
| Go tests | 531 |
| **Baseline including tests** | **18,584** |

Target fewer than 15,909 production Rust and Common Lisp lines and fewer than
18,584 total lines including their focused tests. Do not meet the target by
compressing formatting, generating source, or moving first-party behavior into
another language.

Do not count `terminal/fbterm/` toward the replacement surface. It is vendored
third-party software and remains an external dependency. Apply the same rule to
libretro cores, c-octo, Game Music Emu, Ogg/Vorbis, Wayland libraries, ECL, and
other mature dependencies.

## Current component boundaries

### Dashboard

`src/deck_menu.cpp` is the 4,499-line dashboard and supervisor. It owns startup,
menu state, rendering composition, touch targeting, keyboard and controller
navigation, settings, Wi-Fi entry, application launch, child return handling,
and the primary polling loop.

The dashboard is partially split into:

- `menu_catalog.cpp`: catalogs and built-in Deck applications
- `menu_credits.cpp`: animated and reduced-motion credits
- `menu_state.cpp`: persistent volume, brightness, and keymap state
- `menu_sound.cpp`: synthesized menu cues and their worker process
- `menu_ui.cpp`: bitmap text and pixel primitives
- `menu_network.cpp`, `menu_io.cpp`, and `menu_text.cpp`: narrow helpers
- `deck_wayland.cpp`: widget, layer-shell, shared-memory, and Wayland input

### Shared native runtime

`deck_runtime.cpp`, `deck_wayland.cpp`, and `joypad_input.cpp` provide the
shared framebuffer, Wayland, input, audio, scaling, and frame-clock mechanisms.
They are the clearest initial boundary for thin Rust primitives.

The current Wayland client uses generated bindings for the Deck widget protocol
and wlr-layer-shell. It submits XRGB8888 shared-memory buffers. The fbdev
fallback writes RGB565 frames with the device-reported stride and rotates the
1280x480 logical canvas into the 600x1280 physical framebuffer.

### Applications and emulators

- `libretro_deck.cpp` hosts the external FCEUmm, Gambatte, and Fuse cores.
- `chip8_deck.cpp` and `chip8_core.c` adapt the external c-octo core.
- `chiptune_deck.cpp` uses external Game Music Emu and Ogg/Vorbis libraries.
- `ten_seconds_deck.cpp` implements the native 10 Seconds application.

Preserve the external cores and libraries. Replace only the Deck-owned hosts,
adapters, and application policy.

### Uploader

The uploader contains 2,016 production Go lines and 531 test lines. It provides
an owner-facing HTTP login, ROM upload, palette editing, catalog persistence,
and BMC scene installation. It uses only the Go standard library, but combines
HTTP serving, authentication, validation, storage, UI generation, and setup
operations in one binary.

Preserve the visible upload and palette workflows. Do not automatically recreate
its current service structure or defensive complexity in Rust.

### Existing Common Lisp

`deploy/menu/compile-catalog.lisp` is a 414-line ECL program that validates
`games.sexp` and palette overrides and emits TSV consumed by C++. It is useful
validation code, but it is not yet the product orchestrator.

The deployment already ships static ECL 26.5.5 for ARMv7. Its current build has
threads, DFFI, and the compiler disabled. The migration must prove the smallest
reliable Rust/ECL boundary before committing to an integration shape.

## Static user-visible contract

- Use a 1280x480 logical surface.
- Preserve nearest-neighbor pixels and the custom 5x7 bitmap font.
- Preserve 4-pixel cut corners and 4-pixel default borders.
- Preserve system order: NES, GAME BOY, GBC, ZX SPECTRUM, CHIP-8, DECK.
- Show at most three centered 216x264 cards with the established spacing,
  arrows, indicators, covers, fallback art, and title truncation.
- Require press and release over the same touch target for activation.
- Preserve every settings, Wi-Fi, credits, reboot, and child-exit touch region.
- Preserve the full-screen two-second touch hold that exits an unmanaged child.
- Preserve the four-second double-confirmation window for reboot.
- Preserve exact menu cue notes and durations:
  - volume: 660 Hz for 60 ms, then 880 Hz for 60 ms
  - previous: 523 Hz for 35 ms
  - next: 659 Hz for 35 ms
  - confirm: 659 Hz for 25 ms, then 880 Hz for 30 ms
  - back: 659 Hz for 25 ms, then 440 Hz for 30 ms
- Preserve state and ROM paths below `/mnt/data` and preserve emulator arguments,
  environment, save formats, and sidecars.

Colors, labels, app definitions, ordering, timing values, the 10 Seconds clock
skew, sound sequencing, interaction rules, and other editable policy belong in
startup-loaded Lisp. Pixel buffers, input descriptors, audio output, Wayland
objects, and process primitives belong in Rust.

## Dashboard audio defect

Menu audio was already asynchronous: `MenuSoundPlayer::play` forks a child that
performs the blocking `/dev/dsp` write. Touch appeared blocked because
`menu_sound_blocks_input` deliberately discarded every touch report while that
child was alive and for its 60 ms tail.

Commit `47c2b36` corrects the reference implementation so touch and keyboard
remain responsive while a cue plays. Controller quarantine remains unchanged.
The migration must preserve the cue waveform and trigger timing while keeping
audio work and waits out of the Wayland/input event path.

## Native host checkpoint

Native ABI 3 now provides the first dashboard-side Wayland mechanism without
replacing the working dashboard. Rust binds `wl_compositor`, `wl_shm`,
`wl_seat`, and `deck_widget_manager_v1`; creates and configures the widget
surface; manages three XRGB8888 shared-memory buffers with release backpressure;
and queues the existing clamped down, motion, up, and cancel touch reports.
Common Lisp decides whether to open, dispatch, present, consume touch, close, or
honor shutdown. Default startup deliberately leaves the display closed.

Host tests cover frame geometry, touch clamping, Lisp policy conversions, the
ECL boundary, generated protocol bindings, and static ARM linkage. A deployed
ARM smoke also confirms ABI 3 and both one-argument Wayland callbacks while the
display is closed. The allocated Deck cannot advertise the custom protocol
because its firmware has no BMC compositor, so actual wire events, scene
lifecycle, compositor hit testing, and physical Wayland touch remain acceptance
work rather than inferred parity.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 1,868
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 2,149 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard policy checkpoint

Startup-loaded `lisp/policy.lisp` now owns the exact system order and labels,
all 22 semantic dashboard colors, executable routes, built-in Deck applications
and their append order, launch arguments and environment ordering, volume and
brightness steps, controller limits, reboot text, terminal label, reduced-motion
environment name, and dashboard timing values. Its launch-plan functions retain
the GBC-to-GB route, Deck and chiptune argument differences, touch supervision,
terminal console mirroring, and reboot handling from the C++ dashboard.

`startup.lisp` loads this editable policy before an optional device-local
`local.lisp`. Deployment installs both tracked Lisp files, preserves
`local.lisp`, and validates the ARM/ECL startup as part of activation. The C++
dashboard remains authoritative and continues to render and launch applications
until the Lisp-orchestrated replacement reaches physical parity.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 2,111
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 2,589 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Native fbdev checkpoint

Native ABI 4 adds a direct-fbdev presentation mechanism without changing the
Wayland implementation or replacing the C++ dashboard. Rust uses the narrow
Linux framebuffer ioctl and mmap interface, validates the device-reported
600x1280 RGB565 color fields and stride, builds the rotated 1280x480 image in a
staging buffer, and publishes only completed active rows. Common Lisp controls
open, close, logical-size queries, and 24-bit solid-frame presentation. Default
startup leaves fbdev closed.

Compile-time layout checks cover both 64-bit hosts and the 32-bit ARM ABI. Pure
mechanism tests cover geometry rejection, RGB565 conversion, rotation, stride
padding, and corner placement. The ARM/ECL smoke covers ABI 4 and closed-display
callbacks. On the development Deck, a supervised smoke stopped the dashboard,
presented accent `#xfe6c27` as RGB565 `#xfb64`, captured the 1,638,400-byte
stride-aware scanout, verified all 614,400 active pixels with zero mismatches,
and restored a healthy C++ dashboard. The solid frame validates physical open,
ioctl, mmap, stride, conversion, and publication; physical orientation of a
nonuniform Lisp-rendered frame remains for the next rendering slice.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 2,492
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 3,084 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Native canvas checkpoint

Native ABI 5 adds one startup-owned 1280x480 RGBA canvas backed by pinned
`tiny-skia` 0.12 with only its `std` feature. Rust exposes solid clear and clipped,
non-antialiased integer rectangle fills, then presents the same completed canvas
through either the existing triple-buffered Wayland path or the rotated fbdev
path. Common Lisp owns colors and composition calls. Its wrappers reject values
that cannot cross the fixnum, signed-coordinate, or unsigned-dimension boundary.
Default startup still leaves both displays closed.

Focused tests cover opaque channel order, exact clipping, RGBA-to-XRGB8888 and
RGB565 conversion, rotation, stride padding, ECL callback arity, Lisp wrappers,
and static ARM linkage. On the development Deck, a supervised Lisp smoke cleared
to policy `:background` and drew 320x120 policy-colored rectangles in all four
logical corners: `:accent`, `:selected`, `:wifi-focus`, and `:title`. The smoke
captured all 1,638,400 stride-aware framebuffer bytes and verified every one of
the 614,400 logical pixels through `physical-row = 1279 - logical-x` and
`physical-column = logical-y`, with zero mismatches. It then restored a healthy
C++ dashboard. Physical Wayland presentation remains blocked by the Deck
firmware's missing compositor.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 2,709
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 3,407 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Bitmap UI checkpoint

Native ABI 6 adds the exact reference 5x7 bitmap font as one clipped, scaled
glyph operation. Its 95 printable ASCII mappings, punctuation, lowercase forms,
and unknown-byte fallback match `menu_ui.cpp` row for row. Lisp remains
responsible for UTF-8-to-ASCII display fallback, glyph advance, text width,
scale selection, ellipsis fitting, centering, straight borders, 4-pixel cut
rectangles, and panel composition. One native call per glyph avoids the original
per-pixel ECL crossing cost while leaving labels and layout directly editable in
`lisp/ui.lisp`.

A complete font hash protects every byte mapping. A deterministic 1280x480
fixture exercises policy colors, a cut-corner panel, a straight outline,
centered text, fitted ellipsis, and non-ASCII `?` fallback. The C++ reference and
Rust canvas independently produce RGB565 FNV-1a hash `414079453e1344d5`, while
Lisp tests protect the exact primitive sequence and coordinates. Deployment now
installs and health-checks `startup.lisp`, `ui.lisp`, and `policy.lisp` while
continuing to preserve optional `local.lisp`.

On the development Deck, the same high-level Lisp fixture rendered through ABI
6 and fbdev, yielding a 1,638,400-byte stride-aware capture that matched the C++
reference hash after all 614,400 logical pixels were unrotated. The supervised
smoke then restored a healthy C++ dashboard. Physical Wayland presentation
remains blocked by the missing compositor firmware.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 3,017
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 3,897 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Static dashboard checkpoint

Startup now loads editable `dashboard.lisp` after the native UI and policy
layers and before optional owner `local.lisp` overrides. Lisp owns the exact
credits and settings controls, populated system tabs, three-card carousel
window, selection geometry, pixel-cut cards, cartridge fallback art, compact
built-in Deck logos, mirrored arrows, indicators, and status footer. Geometry,
labels, colors, and composition order remain ordinary device-editable Lisp.

A deterministic nine-game fixture fixes the six populated tabs, shifted NES
carousel, selected third game, long-title fitting, four indicators, and status
text. The authoritative C++ renderer pins the complete logical RGB565 frame at
FNV-1a `65b48f5f3b66d535`; focused Lisp tests pin matching layout metadata,
selected fills and footer text, plus empty-system, single-card, and covered-game
fallback behavior. Covered catalog entries deliberately keep deterministic
fallback art until the narrow raster-blit slice arrives, while the working C++
dashboard remains deployed and authoritative.

On the development Deck, the installed Lisp fixture rendered through ABI 6 and
fbdev. Its 1,638,400-byte stride-aware capture produced the same
`65b48f5f3b66d535` hash after all 614,400 logical pixels were unrotated with
`physical-row = 1279 - logical-x` and `physical-column = logical-y`. The
supervised fixture then restored a healthy C++ dashboard. Physical Wayland
presentation remains blocked by the missing compositor firmware.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 3,335
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 4,282 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard raster checkpoint

Native ABI 7 adds three small process-local raster operations: load a cover,
load a dimension-checked PNG, and draw a cached handle. Rust uses the maintained
`png` 0.18 decoder and retains the authoritative P6 PPM fallback rather than
introducing an image framework. Common Lisp owns the editable cover directory
and settings-icon path, preloads assets before interaction, caches handles, and
chooses their exact dashboard placement. Clearing the Lisp cache also releases
the corresponding native raster storage.

Cover intake preserves PNG priority, PPM fallback only when PNG is absent,
regular-file byte bounds, 1..2048 PNG dimensions, aspect-preserving nearest
reduction to 600x378, alpha flattening against each game's policy color, and
xterm-256 quantization. Drawing preserves the centered square crop and nearest
sampling into the 200x200 card art region. The approved 23x23 settings PNG keeps
its original alpha and the reference RGB565 blend while scaling to the centered
50x50 control image. Missing or invalid images retain the established fallback
art.

A deterministic full-frame fixture uses the approved gear PNG both as the
settings asset and as the selected cover. The C++ reference pins its logical
RGB565 FNV-1a hash at `5c932dc59681241e`. On the development Deck, the installed
ABI 7 Lisp/native fixture produced a 1,638,400-byte stride-aware capture with
the same hash after all 614,400 logical pixels were unrotated. The supervised
fixture then restored a healthy C++ dashboard. Physical Wayland presentation
remains blocked by the missing compositor firmware.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 4,087
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 5,251 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard touch boundary checkpoint

Native ABI 8 adds one synchronous `evdev` 0.13.2-backed Goodix reader for the
fbdev fallback. Rust scans only numbered `/dev/input/event*` devices, requires
the authoritative device-name substring, exact 0..1279 and 0..479 absolute
ranges, and `BTN_TOUCH`, then uses a non-blocking descriptor and best-effort
exclusive grab. The small report state machine preserves coordinate clamping,
press and release edges, every `SYN_REPORT`, and the reference
`SYN_DROPPED` resynchronization boundary. Wayland and evdev now return the same
five-value touch report to Lisp.

Common Lisp owns primary-dashboard targeting and state transitions. It preserves
target priority, half-open bounds, press and release over the same target,
drag-off and cancellation behavior, tab selection and reset, carousel wrapping,
status clearing, and the absence of a cue when the active tab is tapped. Accepted
navigation renders and presents first, then triggers the existing asynchronous
cue without consulting controller-only audio quarantine. Settings, credits,
card launch, keyboard, and controller actions remain outside this narrow slice.

A shared deterministic trace covers two Next activations, a drag from Next to
Previous, a GAME BOY tab activation, and a repeated active-tab tap. The C++
reference pins the corresponding logical RGB565 hashes at
`9f7ec7647982e7bd`, `de67cf4c35ff2b4d`, and `4e9094bcf7a7f9e5`; Lisp pins the
same state, render, and cue sequence. Focused tests also process a second touch
while native audio reports active, preserving the known-defect fix.

Host tests, static ARM/ECL verification, `nix flake check`, and complete
activation passed. With the C++ dashboard stopped under an automatic restore
trap, the deployed native process opened and exclusively owned the physical
Goodix device. The installed Lisp fixture then rendered its initial NES frame
through fbdev; its 1,638,400-byte capture unrotated to C++ hash
`0ef078d4dc7a53bd`. The normal C++ dashboard was restored healthy after each
exercise. No physical touch occurred during the unattended 60-second report
window, so actual panel navigation and cue-overlap responsiveness still require
an operator at the Deck.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 4,586
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 6,034 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard credits checkpoint

Startup-loaded `credits.lisp` now owns the exact credits TSV contract, labels,
archive path, wrapping, crawl construction, source positions, starfield,
perspective geometry, speed and cycle timing, reduced-motion columns,
unavailable state, close control, and same-target close touch transition. The
working C++ dashboard remains authoritative and deployed; this slice adds no
new production service or replacement menu loop.

Native ABI 9 added bounded descriptor-based regular-file reads plus cached
bitmap text masks and exact projected-text drawing on the existing canvas. Rust
preserves the C++ perspective equations, floor/ceiling sampling, clipping, fade,
and RGB565 alpha-256 blend while Lisp supplies all content, geometry, colors,
and timing. ABI 10 adds a four-word RGB565 canvas hash for parity fixtures and
transports elapsed time as 16 ASCII hexadecimal digits, preserving signed
64-bit timing beyond the ARM ECL fixnum range without moving timing policy into
Rust.

The authoritative C++ renderer pins animated full frames at 0, 2,000, 20,000,
and 600,000,000 ms to `94ebf079be6e596b`, `1f14f6b786549363`,
`6267b51f6f787c83`, and `f62d9d0147c7461a`. Reduced-motion frames at 0 and
60,000 ms both pin to `9a44bcef4a13dde3`. Host tests, `nix flake check`, static
ARM verification, and complete deployment passed. On the development Deck, all
six installed Lisp/native frames produced 1,638,400-byte stride-aware captures
with those same hashes after all 614,400 logical RGB565 pixels were unrotated by
`physical-row = 1279 - logical-x` and `physical-column = logical-y`. Animated
and reduced-motion captures were also inspected visually, then the normal C++
dashboard was restored healthy. Physical Wayland presentation remains blocked
by the missing compositor firmware.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 5,551
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 7,306 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard settings checkpoint

Startup-loaded `settings.lisp` now owns the exact settings labels, geometry,
state paths, selection order, rendering, and action sequencing. It reproduces
the network summary, volume, brightness, terminal, keymap, close control, and
status footer, including the reduced footer scale for long messages. All eight
half-open touch targets require press and release over the same target.
Controller previous/next selection wraps in the original order, confirm
activates the selection, and back produces the close plan.

Lisp also owns volume decrement, mute, last-audible restore, brightness
clamping, US/CZ keymap toggling, persistence plans, completion state, and menu
cue effects. Volume stop or confirmation audio is emitted only after its state
write succeeds; failed volume writes emit no audio, and a failed confirmation
tone preserves the successful value while showing the original failure status.
Brightness and keymap cues remain unconditional, matching the C++ sequence.
Wi-Fi editing and terminal launch remain later integration slices. The working
C++ dashboard is still authoritative and deployed, and native ABI 10 is
unchanged.

The authoritative C++ renderer and ARM/ECL smoke test pin these frames:

| Fixture | RGB565 FNV-1a hash |
| --- | --- |
| volume 42, brightness 60, US, volume-down selected | `46d1527abb9f2bcb` |
| muted volume, brightness 60, US, volume-up selected | `c2c55ee7eb47608b` |
| volume 42, maximum brightness, US, brightness-up selected | `6e348df7ca27725f` |
| volume 42, brightness 60, CZ, keymap selected | `99ed5871b55b5f6b` |
| volume 42, brightness 60, US, Wi-Fi selected | `65f7d573c69bccbb` |
| volume 42, brightness 60, US, terminal selected | `9cabcc3df5188ce3` |
| confirmation-tone failure status | `05a5652bb03e0b8b` |
| reduced-scale long status | `773a6a165672bd8b` |

Host policy and C++ fixture tests, `nix flake check`, static ARM verification,
complete deployment, and the Deck health check passed. With the C++ dashboard
stopped under an automatic restore trap, each installed Lisp/native fixture
validated its in-memory canvas hash, presented through fbdev, and produced a
1,638,400-byte stride-aware capture. Unrotating all 614,400 logical RGB565
pixels with `physical-row = 1279 - logical-x` and `physical-column = logical-y`
reproduced all eight hashes. The selected controls, mute, maximum brightness,
CZ keymap, Wi-Fi, terminal, tone-failure status, and reduced-scale status
captures were inspected visually. The normal C++ dashboard was then restored
healthy. Physical Wayland presentation remains blocked by the missing
compositor firmware.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 6,037
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 8,013 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard Wi-Fi editor checkpoint

Startup-loaded `wifi.lisp` now owns the exact editor labels, geometry, key rows,
field limits, helper path, rendering, hit testing, editing state, validation,
and save/back action plans. It preserves the 30-key alphabet layout, uppercase
mode, 42-key symbol layout, active field borders, masked password tail, status
and network footers, and every half-open control and key bound. Touch requires
press and release over the same target. Menu controller and keyboard commands
remain modal: only Back closes the editor.

SSID and password edits retain the original 32- and 63-character limits and
clear stale status after every accepted target, including no-op delete and
full-field insertion. Save validation accepts only printable ASCII, requires an
SSID of 1 through 32 characters and a password of 8 through 63 characters, and
prepares the existing helper with exactly `ssid`, newline, password, newline on
standard input. A successful completion clears the in-memory password and shows
the deferred-use status; failure retains both fields and displays the helper
error. Save always produces the Confirm cue, editing produces Next, and Back
produces the original dashboard status and Back cue. Existing C++ remains
responsible for helper execution until the full Lisp loop is integrated. The
working C++ dashboard remains authoritative and deployed, native ABI 10 is
unchanged, and terminal launch remains a later slice.

The authoritative C++ renderer and ARM/ECL smoke test pin these frames:

| Fixture | RGB565 FNV-1a hash |
| --- | --- |
| empty lowercase alphabet editor | `d6be2f43c4faf0e6` |
| empty uppercase alphabet editor | `7682dc83b0062730` |
| uppercase password field with `NETWORK` and masked `password` | `a5c18f4c41654088` |
| symbol keyboard with the same populated fields | `f919741f85fe2c31` |

Host tests, `nix flake check`, static ARM verification, complete deployment, and
the Deck health check passed. With the C++ dashboard stopped under an automatic
restore trap, each installed Lisp/native fixture validated its in-memory canvas
hash, presented through fbdev, and produced a 1,638,400-byte stride-aware
capture. Unrotating all 614,400 logical RGB565 pixels with
`physical-row = 1279 - logical-x` and `physical-column = logical-y` reproduced
all four hashes. Lowercase, uppercase, populated password, and symbol captures
were inspected visually, then the normal C++ dashboard was restored healthy.
Physical Wayland presentation remains blocked by the missing compositor
firmware.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 6,462
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 8,641 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets without
compressed or generated first-party source.

## Settings terminal process checkpoint

Startup-loaded `process.lisp` now owns terminal titles, the exact starting and
return statuses, native-result validation, launch-plan validation, and the
required menu-audio finish before process handoff. It consumes the existing
Lisp launch policy unchanged: executable, one mode argument, the selected
`RETRO_DECK_KEYMAP`, label, touch supervision, and console mirroring remain
editable without rebuilding Rust. The exact shell results are preserved:
`TERMINAL ERROR - CHECK LOG`, `TERMINAL DID NOT START`, `RETURNED FROM
TERMINAL`, `TERMINAL EXITED`, nonzero status, signal, and generic stopped
variants.

Native ABI 11 adds only the four-argument `RUN-TERMINAL` mechanism and a fixed
five-field result. The Rust supervisor closes direct fbdev while retaining an
open Wayland widget, snapshots `/dev/tty0`, starts a separate child process
group with default TERM/INT/HUP/PIPE handling, and distinguishes exec failure.
It polls in 40 ms slices, retries fbdev touch discovery at most once per second,
requires an uninterrupted full-screen two-second hold, sends process-group
SIGTERM, escalates to SIGKILL after four seconds, and restores keyboard mode,
termios, cursor, wake, and blanking state. On Wayland it samples `/dev/fb0`
every 100 ms, applies the authoritative RGB565 scanout rotation, and presents
through the existing triple-SHM widget buffers.

The C++ dashboard remains authoritative and deployed. `RETRODECK:MAIN` still
does not enter the replacement dashboard loop, so this callable Lisp slice
cannot alter the working menu before the remaining input and return-loop slices
reach parity.

Host tests and `nix flake check` passed. The static ARM/ECL smoke exercised the
real callback under QEMU with exact mode/keymap propagation, clean exit,
nonzero exit, signal exit, and exec failure. ABI 11 and all editable Lisp files
were installed on the ARMv7 Deck. An installed harmless fixture received
exactly `shell` and `cz`, returned `TERMINAL EXITED`, and left the C++ dashboard
healthy. A second physical fixture ignored SIGTERM in both parent and
grandchild; terminating the native host caused process-group SIGTERM and the
four-second SIGKILL escalation, returned signal 9, removed the group, and again
left the dashboard healthy. The Deck health check passed. Current fbdev-only
firmware cannot physically exercise Wayland console mirroring, and an operator
is still required for an actual two-second Goodix touch-return acceptance.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 7,137
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 9,552 lines with
focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard keyboard and controller boundary checkpoint

Native ABI 12 adds four narrow evdev control primitives: scan, close, dispatch,
and next report. Rust scans only numeric `/dev/input/eventN` nodes, opens them
read-only, nonblocking, and close-on-exec, retains at most two exact
vendor `1c59` product `0026` THEGamepads ordered by physical path and at most
four complete keyboards ordered by event path, and attempts keyboard grabs
without making grab failure fatal. Keyboard snapshots reconstruct both Shift
keys. THEGamepad snapshots reconstruct all eight raw buttons and both axes, use
the authoritative inclusive one-third thresholds, and emit only rising edges at
`SYN_REPORT`. Both readers ignore stale input after `SYN_DROPPED` until the next
report boundary, then resynchronize without inventing an edge. Device loss
closes only the failed descriptor and requests a rescan. A bounded native batch
coalesces gamepad edges and duplicate keyboard reports before Lisp receives
raw mechanism data.

Startup-loaded `policy.lisp` owns the editable keyboard and THEGamepad maps,
Shift-Tab behavior, dashboard command priority, modal and settings routing,
once-per-second scan schedule, immediate loss rescan, the exact twelve-edge
one-second burst guard, and one-second quiet recovery. The existing menu-sound
policy still counts a gamepad edge before quarantine, blocks only controller
commands while a cue is active, and leaves keyboard and touch input responsive.
No dashboard action names, modal knowledge, burst timing, or audio policy moved
into Rust.

The C++ dashboard remains authoritative and deployed. `RETRODECK:MAIN` still
does not enter the replacement loop, so this callable boundary cannot alter the
working menu before the remaining orchestration and return-loop slices reach
parity.

All host tests, `nix flake check`, and the complete static ARM verification
passed. The real ARM/ECL smoke exercised ABI 12, empty-device dispatch, scan
failure, editable mappings, modal priority, scan timing, and guard state under
QEMU. ABI 12 and all eight Lisp files were installed on the ARMv7 Deck. Its only
physical evdev node was the Goodix touchscreen; the installed fixture correctly
reported zero gamepads and zero keyboards without grabbing or misclassifying
Goodix, and the Deck health check left the C++ dashboard healthy. Connected
keyboard and THEGamepad hot-plug, repeat, Shift-Tab, axis, button, disconnect,
and resynchronization acceptance remain blocked until those physical devices
are attached.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 8,032
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 11,018 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard loop boundary checkpoint

Startup-loaded `dashboard.lisp` now contains a pure, non-authoritative dashboard
state reducer and two-phase loop boundary. Common Lisp composes the verified
dashboard, settings, Wi-Fi, credits, touch, keyboard, THEGamepad, audio,
process, rendering, and timing slices without moving policy into Rust. Ordered
effects are interpreted recursively, so synchronous settings, network, Wi-Fi,
volume-tone, launch, control-scan, presentation-open, and volume-reload
completions occur at the same point as the authoritative C++ operation.

The pre-poll phase reaps menu sound first, recovers the controller burst guard
only after the required quiet period, retries disconnected fbdev touch at most
once per second, and performs due, forced, or disconnect-requested control
scans. The post-poll phase expires reboot confirmation, refreshes network state,
and animates credits before input. Controller and keyboard commands are reduced
before touch, a command discards the same poll's touch batch, and touch reports
are processed serially against freshly rendered layouts. Touch read failure
clears every pressed target before controls continue. Controller edges are still
counted before explicit audio quarantine, while keyboard and touch remain
responsive during cues.

Game, terminal, and reboot requests retain the exact render, present, sound
finish, control close, and launch order. Child return retains the forced control
scan, presentation reopen, volume reload, result-status precedence, and final
render/present sequence. Touch-originated launch requests wait until the complete
native report batch has been reduced; controller-originated requests discard
touch and prepare immediately. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged, and the C++
dashboard is still authoritative and deployed.

All host tests, `cargo check`, `cargo test`, `nix flake check`, and complete
static ARM verification passed. Updated `startup.lisp`, `policy.lisp`, and
`dashboard.lisp` were installed on the ARMv7 Deck. The normal installed startup
loaded successfully, then a harmless ARM/ECL fixture exercised pre-poll recovery
and scanning plus the complete simulated game launch and child-return trace. It
finished at `ALPHA EXITED`, retained the child-updated volume, and rendered an
in-memory RGB565 hash of `73c31d7a148f01f5` without opening a display, reading
input, playing audio, or starting a child. The running C++ dashboard retained
the same PID and the Deck health check passed afterward. Physical cue-overlap,
connected keyboard/THEGamepad, terminal-hold, and Wayland acceptance blockers
remain unchanged.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 8,930
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 12,763 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard runtime adapter checkpoint

Startup-loaded `dashboard.lisp` now also contains a compact mutable runtime
adapter for the completed reducer. It remains non-authoritative and does not
change `RETRODECK:MAIN`. The adapter maps ordered reducer effects onto the
existing canvas, fbdev or Wayland presentation, evdev touch and controls,
non-blocking menu audio, settings, Wi-Fi, network, launch, and child-recovery
boundaries while external handlers continue to supply normalized policy
completions.

Initialization now preserves the authoritative order: acquire or explicitly
adopt a presentation, open fbdev touch, force a control scan, obtain startup
connectivity, then render and present the first frame. Failure unwinds controls,
touch, and only adapter-owned presentation state. Borrowed fbdev and Wayland
state is never closed implicitly; fbdev launch requires explicit ownership
transfer because the child mechanism closes that display. Normal shutdown is
idempotent and releases owned audio, controls, touch, and presentation state.

The adapter distinguishes a newly started cue from an already-busy native audio
worker, retains responsibility for its own post-cue controller quarantine after
the worker exits, and never stops borrowed audio. Input dispatch uses cached
audio state, completes timer and network effects before closing failed touch,
and refreshes its monotonic clock immediately after a blocking child returns so
recovery scans carry the return time rather than the selection time.

All host tests, direct Cargo checks, `nix flake check`, and complete static
ARM/ECL verification passed. Updated `startup.lisp` and `dashboard.lisp` were
installed on the ARMv7 Deck. The installed startup loaded successfully, then a
harmless alternate ARM/ECL fixture exercised startup connectivity, rendering,
presentation, cue ownership, keyboard launch, post-child control scan,
presentation reopen, volume reload, final rendering, and owned-resource
shutdown. It finished at `ALPHA EXITED` with volume 47 and in-memory RGB565 hash
`37e9949718aa8c45` without opening a display, reading input, playing audio, or
starting a child. The authoritative C++ dashboard retained PID 17517 and the
Deck health check passed.

The adapter still accepts normalized input snapshots; unified native polling
across Wayland or fbdev touch and evdev controls remains a later mechanism
slice. Physical cue-overlap, connected keyboard/THEGamepad, terminal-hold, and
Wayland acceptance blockers remain unchanged.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 9,250
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 13,767 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard polling adapter checkpoint

Native ABI 13 adds one aggregate input poll rather than serially blocking on
separate touch and control dispatchers. Rust waits once on the selected Wayland
connection or fbdev touchscreen, followed by stable gamepad and keyboard
descriptors. Ready gamepads and keyboards are drained before touch, preserving
the authoritative C++ descriptor and read order. Existing queue-first behavior,
EINTR deadline handling, control loss and rescan, fbdev touch loss, Wayland
shutdown, report decoding, and resynchronization stay inside their established
native modules.

The fixed native result is `(ready control-count touch-count touch-lost rescan
shutdown)`. Startup-loaded Lisp validates it, drains and maps raw reports under
editable policy, captures one post-poll input time, and produces the normalized
snapshot consumed by the runtime adapter. Rust does not map actions or inspect
audio state. The runtime still counts controller edges before applying its
cached cue quarantine, while keyboard and touch remain responsive during menu
sounds. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged and the C++ dashboard remains
authoritative.

Host policy and mechanism tests, direct Cargo checks, `nix flake check`, and the
complete static ARM/ECL matrix passed. ABI 13, `startup.lisp`, `policy.lisp`, and
`dashboard.lisp` were installed on the ARMv7 Deck. A harmless installed fixture
left the Goodix touchscreen closed, confirmed its controls scan remained zero
keyboards and zero THEGamepads, measured the shared empty-input timeout at 40
ms, and exercised the real native-to-Lisp normalized snapshot. The authoritative
C++ dashboard retained PID 17517 and the Deck health check remained healthy.
Connected keyboard/THEGamepad and Wayland-compositor physical acceptance remain
blocked by the same unavailable hardware and firmware.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 9,586
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 14,278 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard network status checkpoint

Native ABI 14 adds one read-only Linux network-status mechanism. Rust preserves
the authoritative `menu_network.cpp` behavior: the first IPv4 address for
`wlan0` and `wg0` comes from `getifaddrs`, the `wlan0` SSID comes from
`SIOCGIWESSID`, valid non-ASCII display codepoints become `?`, and the selector
status comes only from an absolute bounded regular file without following a
symbolic link. Missing interfaces and failed reads retain the original empty or
`STATUS UNAVAILABLE` results.

The fixed native result is `(ssid wlan-ipv4 wireguard-ipv4 selector)`. Lisp
validates that tuple, owns `/var/run/deck-wifi/status` through editable
`*dashboard-wifi-paths*`, converts the values to the dashboard network plist,
and emits the existing `:network-result` completion. A runtime without an
injected external handler now performs the concrete startup read and every
scheduled `:network-action`; an injected handler can still replace the effect
for fixtures or later composition. Settings writes, Wi-Fi profile updates, and
child launch remain separate later slices. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged
and the C++ dashboard remains authoritative.

Host tests, direct Cargo checks, `nix flake check`, and the complete ARM/ECL
matrix passed. ABI 14 plus the updated startup, Wi-Fi policy, and dashboard files
were installed on the Deck with matching hashes. A harmless installed fixture
read `Zyxel_7B79_5G`, `192.168.1.213`, `10.0.0.17`, and `CONNECTED` through the
concrete runtime effect without opening a display or input device. The C++
dashboard retained PID 17517 and the Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 9,804
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 14,573 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Dashboard runtime coordinator checkpoint

The startup-loaded Lisp runtime now exposes one compact callable iteration. It
reads the monotonic clock before pre-poll recovery, runs the existing reducer
effects, selects the editable main or animated timeout from current state,
performs the aggregate native input poll, consumes the post-poll timestamp and
normalized reports, dispatches timers and input, and returns the updated state,
runtime, and combined effect trace. Native shutdown in the returned snapshot
still performs the existing idempotent runtime cleanup.

This coordinator adds no Rust policy or service boundary. It only joins the
already verified initialization, reducer, timeout, polling, dispatch, and
shutdown adapters, and `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged. Focused tests cover
the 250 ms dashboard policy, 40 ms animated-credits policy, ordered effect
traces, returned runtime identity, post-poll clock ownership, and native
shutdown cleanup.

Host tests, fresh and persistent SBCL runs, `nix flake check`, and the complete
ARM/ECL matrix passed. The updated startup and dashboard files were installed on
the Deck with matching hashes. A harmless installed fixture ran one complete
closed-input iteration at times 1001/1002 with trace `((:REAP-SOUND))`, then
shut down only its in-memory adapter state. The C++ dashboard retained PID 17517
and the Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 9,821
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 14,647 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Lisp-owned volume state checkpoint

Native ABI 15 adds one generic state-file mechanism rather than volume policy.
Reads preserve the C++ distinction between missing files and exact bounded bytes,
follow existing symlinks, and reject nonregular or larger-than-64-byte state.
Writes publish exact bytes through private `0600` `O_EXCL` temporary files,
file sync, close, rename, and best-effort parent-directory sync. Rust does not
parse volume values or append canonical delimiters.

Startup-loaded Lisp now owns the exact `RETRO_DECK_VOLUME_PERCENT` default,
including empty, decimal, range, and leading-zero behavior; canonical `0` through
`100` state parsing; missing-state initialization; `on\n` and `off\n` migration;
settings saves; and post-child reload. Runtime initialization retains the startup
default for later missing or legacy child state, updates the remembered audible
volume exactly, saves before reducer state changes, and treats child reload
failure as logging-only recovery. Brightness effects remain delegated,
`RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged, and the C++ dashboard stays authoritative.

The focused host suite, named and fresh SBCL runs, direct Cargo checks, `nix
flake check`, and the complete ARM/ECL matrix passed. Installed ABI 15 and the
startup, settings, and dashboard Lisp files matched repository hashes. A harmless
Deck fixture exercised inherited default zero, missing initialization, legacy
migration, canonical settings save, changed child reload, malformed child reload
recovery, and a final `63\n` private state file without opening display or input.
The C++ dashboard retained PID 16416 and the Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 10,154
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 15,225 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Lisp-owned terminal keymap state checkpoint

Native ABI 15 remains a generic exact-byte state-file mechanism. Startup-loaded
Lisp now owns the authoritative terminal keymap contract: only lowercase `us`
and `cz` are valid, state is exactly `us\n` or `cz\n`, a missing file defaults
to US and writes `us\n`, and malformed existing bytes are rejected and
preserved rather than reset or migrated.

The non-authoritative runtime accepts the editable keymap state path and loads
volume followed by keymap before opening presentation or input resources. Its
no-handler settings fallback saves volume and keymap through ABI 15 before the
reducer mutates state; a keymap save failure preserves the prior selection,
shows `KEYMAP STATE ERROR`, and still emits the confirmation cue. Brightness
remains delegated to an injected external handler. Terminal launch continues to
receive the current selection only through `RETRO_DECK_KEYMAP`, and child return
reloads volume but not keymap. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged and the C++
dashboard stays authoritative.

Named and fresh SBCL runs, the complete host suite, ARM/ECL matrix, `nix flake
check`, and an independent parity review passed. The deployed native host and
startup, settings, and dashboard Lisp files matched repository hashes. A
harmless installed fixture exercised missing initialization, existing Czech
state, malformed-state rejection and preservation, and an exact canonical
settings save without opening display or input. Its final `cz\n` file was three
bytes with mode `0600`; the C++ dashboard retained PID 22788 and the Deck health
check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 10,202
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 15,392 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Lisp-owned brightness state checkpoint

Native ABI 16 adds one generic control-file mechanism rather than brightness
policy. Reads follow existing links and return at most the first 63 exact bytes;
writes accept at most 64 exact bytes for an existing absolute path. Regular-file
truncation mirrors C++, while `EINVAL` and `EPERM` remain acceptable for sysfs.
Rust contains no backlight paths, whitespace rules, numeric parsing, newline
construction, percentages, rounding, defaults, or settings policy.

Startup-loaded Lisp now owns the exact dashboard brightness contract. It reads
maximum then current hardware before state, trims only ASCII bytes 9, 10, 11,
12, 13, and 32, accepts only decimal digits through `UINT_MAX`, rejects zero
maximum and current above maximum, and accepts only canonical `10\n` through
`100\n` in ten-point steps. Missing state computes
`(current*100 + maximum/2) / maximum`, rounds with `(observed+5)/10*10`, and
clamps 10 through 100. Startup always maps with
`(percent*maximum + 50)/100`, clamps 1 through maximum, writes hardware, then
atomically saves state. Malformed existing state is fatal and preserved; hardware
failure prevents the state write, while state failure leaves hardware changed
without updating reducer memory.

The non-authoritative runtime now initializes volume, brightness, then keymap
before opening presentation or input. It retains the startup maximum only after
successful normalization, clears it on every failed initialization or shutdown,
and uses it for the no-handler settings fallback. A settings failure preserves
the old percentage, reports `BRIGHTNESS ERROR - CHECK LOG`, and still emits the
original Previous or Next cue. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged and the C++
dashboard stays authoritative.

Named and fresh SBCL runs, the complete host suite, direct Cargo checks, the
ARM/ECL matrix, `nix flake check`, and an independent parity review passed.
Installed hashes were `ffef972cc96b74139e076cb9dcc8843bb6a0143bacb85c012c977c82b50390f5`
for ABI 16, `96b4440bd715b975ee4b1154c29aa4c55dc14de5ef1a491be74e49a2e454b7ea`
for startup, `5b27c41f5fb9afb1ae0a91b1ac6cf147931a0b3ae31ed8bacd3e76a74be61376`
for settings, and `22e20831ba7786fb0ade87fbea68c8260af5e9392043ecfc3dcb5dad5e218dc3`
for the dashboard. A harmless installed regular-file fixture, never the real
backlight, exercised missing adoption to `60\n`, existing `70\n` application to
raw `14\n`, malformed `05\n` rejection and preservation, and the runtime settings
fallback. Its final device and private state files were exact three-byte `14\n`
and `70\n`, with state mode `0600`; the C++ dashboard retained PID 22788 and the
Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 10,488
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 16,068 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Lisp-owned Wi-Fi profile save checkpoint

Native ABI 17 adds one generic synchronous helper mechanism. Rust receives an
executable and exact input bytes, starts a no-argument child with inherited
environment, standard output, and standard error, writes and explicitly closes
stdin, waits, and returns the start, input, wait, exit, or signal result. An
input write or close failure takes precedence over the reaped child result.
Rust contains no Wi-Fi path, text limits, validation, request formatting,
status labels, cue selection, or dashboard state policy.

Startup-loaded Lisp owns the authoritative profile-save contract. SSIDs remain
one through 32 printable ASCII bytes and passphrases eight through 63. Lisp
constructs the exact `SSID\nPASSPHRASE\n` request and helper path, rejects invalid
input before execution, maps only native input failure to
`WIFI PROFILE WRITE FAILED`, and maps start, wait, nonzero exit, or signal to
`WIFI PROFILE WAS NOT SAVED`. Success alone clears the passphrase and reports
`WIFI SAVED - USED AFTER CURRENT WIFI DISCONNECTS`; every completion keeps the
original Confirm cue and render, cue, present ordering. The concrete fallback
runs only when no injected external handler is present. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains
unchanged and the C++ dashboard stays authoritative.

Fresh and named SBCL runs, direct Cargo checks, the complete host suite, ARM/ECL
matrix, `nix flake check`, and two independent parity reviews passed. ARM/ECL
pinned exact stdin, exit 7, signal 15, and input-failure precedence over exit 7.
Installed hashes were
`e9a89cec4f8eaee11d99522ced7bd7a4d8cf2ddd11660f6c4273200fb3ec99e9`
for ABI 17,
`0fa21b078b1104fc8270481ca7744d47450ed0cbaad9c0f3660d78bd7fc9b504`
for startup,
`53f0760969bbbef2755b10d2444decb606a82ba321a1d23987e7c7f6cdc0b70a`
for Wi-Fi policy, and
`4768701d3645e3dd17ea28b3af9a8ed6bb64b36caecf2610fd56426b084c1a2d`
for the dashboard. Harmless installed `/tmp` helpers, never the real profile
helper, exercised no-handler success and exit-7 failure, exact write-failure
status, signal classification, and phase precedence. The captured 18-byte
request had SHA-256
`92d60672226800b929ffedd2d32cb7ec1ff0d65b81937b4b591a4f5ac6a81182`.
Installed permissions remained `0700` for the host and `0600` for Lisp; the C++
dashboard retained PID 2051 and the Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 10,650
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 16,408 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Lisp-owned managed child launch checkpoint

Native ABI 18 adds one generic managed-child mechanism without application
knowledge. Rust receives an executable, an ordered argument list, ordered
environment pairs, a log label, and one touch-supervision flag directly from
Lisp. It closes direct fbdev presentation while retaining an open Wayland
widget, snapshots and restores the TTY, starts a separate process group, keeps
Wayland or evdev supervision outside the child, and polls every 40 ms. Shutdown
or the original uninterrupted two-second touch hold sends TERM; after four
seconds the complete process group receives KILL, including descendants whose
group leader already exited. The fixed result is
`(STARTED TOUCH EXIT-CODE SIGNAL ERROR SHUTDOWN)`. Native list decoding rejects
atoms, improper or circular lists, malformed environment pairs, non-strings,
and embedded NUL bytes without moving launch policy into Rust.

Startup-loaded Lisp now owns the concrete no-handler game and reboot effect.
The existing editable launch plans supply every executable, ordered argument,
ordered environment entry, label, presentation variable, volume variable, and
touch decision. Lisp preserves the authoritative starting render/present,
finishes menu audio exactly once, closes controls, invokes the child, force
rescans controls, reopens presentation, reloads volume, classifies the result,
and renders/presents the final status. The specialized terminal boundary remains
responsible for keymap, mode, touch return, and Wayland console mirroring. Deck
applications remain unsupervised on fbdev but supervised on Wayland; fbdev
return marks touch disconnected so the existing timed reconnect path reopens
it. Injected effect handlers still take priority, including with borrowed fbdev
presentation. Per explicit owner approval, this replacement does not duplicate
the C++ ROM-format validator: Lisp passes the selected path to the established
emulator and lets that emulator reject invalid content. Archive intake behavior
is unchanged. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged and the C++ dashboard stays
authoritative.

Fresh and named SBCL runs, direct Cargo formatting, test, and all-target checks,
the complete host suite, ARM/ECL matrix, `nix flake check`, and two independent
reviews passed. Rust fixtures pinned exact ordered arguments and environment,
clean exit, exit 7, signal 15, missing executable, shutdown propagation, TERM to
KILL escalation, and the leader-exits descendant case. Lisp fixtures pinned
valid and invalid six-field decoding, game/reboot/terminal no-handler dispatch,
external-handler priority, shutdown completion, one audio finish, exact recovery
ordering, and fbdev Deck-touch reconnect. ARM/ECL additionally rejected malformed
native argument and environment lists.

Installed hashes were
`08171e98195dd0e4d9471a77b643176d508a7907f568fa61be6173bd34f049c5`
for ABI 18,

`6eebbb6721b71f5bb1468688fc7de06ca72680d674bac4f91f0f15b525f43628`
for the dashboard. Harmless installed `/tmp` fixtures, never `/sbin/reboot` or a
real emulator, exercised exact argument/environment capture, clean, exit-7,
signal, missing-executable, game, reboot, and specialized terminal paths. Host
and Lisp permissions remained `0700` and `0600`; the C++ dashboard retained PID
2051 and the Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 10,883
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 16,951 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Full-loop rehearsal checkpoint

Startup-loaded Lisp now exposes one explicitly opt-in, non-authoritative
`dashboard-runtime-rehearse` lifecycle wrapper. It initializes an already-built
state and runtime once, assigns every state returned by the existing iteration
coordinator, preserves reducer-selected poll timeouts, records one effect trace
per completed iteration, and returns the final state, runtime, traces, and
`:limit`, `:operator-stop`, or `:shutdown` reason. A finite iteration limit and
an operator stop predicate make host and device rehearsals bounded without
adding policy to Rust.

The wrapper guarantees owned-resource cleanup with `unwind-protect` after
successful initialization. It rejects an already initialized runtime before
reading its clock or entering that cleanup boundary, so an accidental rehearsal
cannot close caller-owned controls, touch, audio, or presentation. Initialization
failure retains the adapter's existing rollback, while poll, render, effect, or
predicate failures propagate after cleanup. `RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged
and the C++ dashboard stays authoritative.

Named and fresh SBCL runs, the complete host suite, ARM build matrix,
`nix flake check`, and two review rounds passed. A first review found and the
final regression test fixed the initialized caller-ownership edge. Updated
`startup.lisp` and `dashboard.lisp` were installed at hashes
`56dfefecb2c3aebdceda017c30470691ec06825afc6f6d3433bbc6e2e0b75342` and
`4bd9baf92dccbca849ce5400a799a5de13219db2d6e39f6cfd4f0fca3f6269fd`.
A harmless alternate installed ARM/ECL fixture exercised two bounded iterations,
operator stop before polling, runtime shutdown, and poll-failure cleanup without
opening the real display or input devices. The C++ dashboard retained PID 2051
and the Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 10,930
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 17,128 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Effective dashboard bootstrap checkpoint

Startup-loaded Lisp now exposes non-authoritative readers for the
launcher-selected effective `games.tsv` and `palette.tsv`. The caller supplies
the selected paths, so a validated `combined-games.tsv` preserves uploaded games
in exact manifest order instead of silently reverting to `games.sexp` or the
base catalog. The manifest reader accepts the existing optional header,
comments, and CRLF form; enforces the 65,536-byte file, 4,096-byte line, 64-game,
ID, system, absolute-path, UTF-8, color-syntax, and duplicate bounds; and converts
each non-ASCII title codepoint to one display `?` exactly like the C++ bitmap UI.
It consumes data only after the launcher's existing native/compiler validation
gate, so xterm-palette validation remains there and the approved omission of
pre-launch ROM-content validation remains in force.

The aggregate reader appends fresh copies of the seven Lisp-owned built-ins and
returns a complete palette in policy role order. It accepts the retired
`settings-icon` row for compatibility, rejects unknown, duplicate, or missing
roles, and falls back all-or-nothing to a fresh startup palette without mutating
global policy. String leaves are copied as well as list structure, so rehearsal
state cannot modify later bootstrap results. The loaded games and dynamically
bound palette are used only by bounded host and ARM/ECL rehearsal fixtures;
`RETRODECK:MAIN` remains unchanged and the C++ dashboard stays authoritative.

Named and fresh SBCL runs, the complete host suite, ARM build matrix, targeted
ARM/ECL smoke, `nix flake check`, and two review rounds passed. ARM/ECL read the
checked-in files through the real native regular-file boundary, accepted a CRLF
combined upload title as `?lu?`, rejected malformed UTF-8, and exercised complete
palette fallback. Commits `1a6a4c6` and `7f67347` were pushed immediately.

The installed effective paths were `/mnt/data/nes-deck/state/games.tsv` and
`/mnt/data/nes-deck/state/palette.tsv`. Installed hashes were
`320cd46d77189b4e604c8aafae0918119c94b9d984fbe1159da2acf818b3cb4e` for
`startup.lisp`, `baf89f646dfcaa59fd425c5e1c90c1a6f096399feb9162d7a437b2e300556422`
for `ui.lisp`, and
`717fcebbecbb850d167f0164282af20ae552d4b25f722c10ae8223fa6303cf4f` for
`policy.lisp`. Normal installed startup and a harmless zero-iteration rehearsal
loaded 15 manifest games plus seven built-ins and all 22 palette roles without
opening real presentation or input devices. The C++ dashboard retained PID 2051
and the Deck health check remained healthy.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 11,169
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 17,628 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

## Lisp-owned presentation selection checkpoint

Native ABI 19 adds one narrow `WAYLAND-OPEN-WIDGET-AT` mechanism. Lisp passes
the exact display string captured when it constructs a runtime; Rust resolves an
absolute display as the socket path itself or appends a relative display to an
absolute `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, opens one Unix stream, and hands it to maintained
`wayland-client` connection handling. Embedded NUL and empty display inputs
fail, as do relative displays when the runtime directory is missing or not
absolute, without protocol reimplementation. The existing zero-argument
environment-based Wayland open is unchanged for explicit backend mode.

Startup-loaded policy names `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. Automatic presentation snapshots
that value once, requests Wayland only when the snapshot is nonempty, adopts an
already-open Wayland widget when present, and otherwise opens the exact captured
display. A failed Wayland open reports its native reason, logs the existing
fallback transition, and then adopts or opens fbdev. Missing or explicitly empty
displays select fbdev directly without a false Wayland failure. Runtime backend
state and ownership continue to determine the matching close operation. Supplying
`:WAYLAND`, including explicit `NIL`, together with enabled
`:AUTO-PRESENTATION` is rejected rather than silently overriding explicit mode.
`RETRODECK:MAIN`, the launcher, and C++ dashboard authority remain unchanged.

Named and fresh SBCL, `cargo fmt --check`, locked Cargo test and all-target
checks, the complete host suite, targeted ARM/ECL smoke, the complete ARM build
matrix, `nix flake check`, and independent review passed. Rust unit coverage pins
absolute and relative socket resolution and invalid runtime directories. ARM/ECL
called the real ABI with relative and absolute missing sockets and an embedded
NUL, while host Lisp fixtures pin the exact captured argument, Wayland adoption,
Wayland-to-fbdev fallback, total failure, explicit-mode primitive, conflicting
keywords, and cleanup ownership. Commit `fa4dd22` was pushed immediately.

The Deck now has ABI 19 at
`e302dc0a7f5a5e3e1fc370c4d1f2af52d4384c9bc1bd590524ae2ee8a672bcd1`,

The host remains mode `0700` and Lisp files mode `0600`. Normal installed
startup passed. A harmless installed fixture replaced only high-level open,
size, and close functions and verified the captured `retrodeck-fixture` name,
failed-Wayland fbdev selection, explicit empty display, unchanged explicit
Wayland mode, adoption without ownership, conflicting-keyword rejection, and
matching cleanup without opening real presentation or input devices. The C++
dashboard retained PID 2051 and the Deck health check remained healthy. Physical
Wayland acceptance still requires firmware containing the BMC compositor.

At this checkpoint the physical Rust and Common Lisp footprint is 11,280
production lines, including the existing catalog compiler, and 17,870 lines
with focused Rust and Lisp tests. This remains below the 15,909/18,584 budgets
without compressed or generated first-party source.

- `/dev/mmcblk0p4`: ext4 and persistently mounted at `/mnt/data`

The allocated Deck firmware does not contain `bmc-compositor`, so the deployed
reference currently uses the supported direct-fbdev fallback. Use it for touch,
audio, launch, emulator, and framebuffer comparisons. Install a compatible BMC
image before claiming Wayland parity.

Still require physical acceptance for:

- touch responsiveness while every menu cue plays
- connected keyboard and THEGamepad hot-plug, repeat, mapping, and recovery
- exact borders, colors, animation, and transition timing
- every external emulator, save path, and return flow
- the terminal's physical two-second Goodix touch-return hold
- Wayland widget movement and game layer surfaces
- chiptune and timer behavior
- uploader and palette editing

## Migration discipline

1. Preserve the working implementation until a replacement slice passes its
   host checks and physical comparison.
2. Migrate narrow vertical slices rather than creating a parallel framework.
3. Record exact behavior before moving policy into Lisp.
4. Reuse existing assets, cores, libraries, paths, and launch contracts.
5. Delete superseded C, C++, and Go only after demonstrated parity.
6. Keep tests focused on migration boundaries and user-visible regressions.
7. Recount Rust and Common Lisp after every substantial slice.
