# Build and test Retro Deck

Retro Deck uses Nix for reproducible ARMv7 hard-float builds. The generated
executables are static and run on the Deck's OpenWrt userspace without copying
a Nix store closure to the device.

For ordinary installation, create the private setup configuration and use the
complete deployment command in [README.md](README.md):

```sh
./ops/configure-deck.sh
./ops/deploy.sh
```

This document covers individual builds, verification, tests, and platform
details for development.

## Prerequisites

Install Nix with flakes enabled. Host tests also require C, C++, Rust, and
Common Lisp compilers, `pkg-config`, libpng and Wayland development headers,
`wayland-scanner`, and ImageMagick.

On Debian or Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install \
  build-essential cargo imagemagick libpng-dev libwayland-dev pkg-config \
  rustc sbcl
```

Then clone the private repository:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:BraiinsForge/retrodeck.git
cd retrodeck
```

The first Nix build downloads the pinned cross toolchain and may take several
minutes. Later builds reuse the Nix store.

Each native runtime receives an explicit local source set. Editing the menu,
for example, invalidates `deck-menu` without rebuilding unrelated emulators.
Keep new source and header files in the corresponding source set near the top
of `flake.nix`; do not add the complete `src/` directory as a build input.

## Build packages individually

Use `--no-link` to avoid leaving `result-*` symlinks in the repository:

```sh
nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#retrodeck-native
nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#nes-deck
nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#gb-deck
nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#zx-deck

nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#ten-seconds-deck
nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#deck-menu
nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#fbterm-deck

### Native orchestrator

`native/` contains `retrodeck-native`, the static ARM Rust/ECL host. It boots
ECL, registers the small `RETRODECK.NATIVE` interface, loads Common Lisp, and
uses the integer returned by `RETRODECK:MAIN` as its process status. With no
argument it loads `/mnt/data/nes-deck/lisp/startup.lisp`; one alternate startup
path may be supplied for development and smoke tests.

`lisp/startup.lisp` validates the native ABI, then loads `ui.lisp`,
`policy.lisp`, `process.lisp`, `settings.lisp`, `wifi.lisp`, `credits.lisp`,
and `dashboard.lisp`. These editable files own bitmap UI composition, systems,
labels, colors, applications, exact game/reboot/terminal executable routes,
ordered arguments and environment, launch/return statuses and sequencing,
timing, settings and Wi-Fi editor state and actions, exact inherited and
persistent volume policy, exact brightness hardware and state policy, exact
terminal keymap state policy, Wi-Fi profile validation, helper request bytes,
completion statuses and cues, credits content and sequencing, dashboard geometry,
touch policy, keyboard and THEGamepad mapping, modal command priority,
controller burst recovery, input scan timing, and the Wi-Fi selector status path.
Startup finally loads an optional `local.lisp` beside them for device-local
overrides without a Rust
rebuild. Deployment updates the eight standard Lisp files but leaves an
existing `local.lisp` untouched.

Native ABI 19 retains the widget-side Wayland and direct-fbdev primitives and
adds one exact-display Wayland open plus only narrow canvas, raster,
projected-text, evdev, regular-file, network, state-file, control-file,
helper-process, audio, managed-child, terminal-process, and aggregate-input
mechanisms for Lisp to orchestrate. The exact-display primitive connects an
absolute socket path directly or a relative name below absolute
`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` through `wayland-client`; the existing environment-based open
remains unchanged for explicit mode. Lisp snapshots the policy-named
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, owns Wayland-first selection and fbdev fallback, and tracks
adoption and cleanup ownership. The bounded state-file mechanism distinguishes
missing files from exact bytes and performs private atomic replacement; Lisp
owns inherited volume parsing, defaults, legacy migration, canonical saves,
child reload policy,
and the exact missing/default/canonical terminal keymap state contract. The
control-file mechanism follows existing links, reads at most 63 exact bytes, and
writes bounded exact bytes to an existing path. Lisp owns brightness parsing,
rounding, startup normalization, hardware-before-state ordering, and settings
failure policy; Rust contains no backlight path or percentage knowledge. The
generic helper primitive starts one no-argument child with inherited environment
and output, writes and closes exact stdin bytes, waits, and reports the start,
input, wait, exit, or signal result. Lisp owns the Wi-Fi helper path, validation,
request construction, user-visible status, state update, and confirmation cue.
The generic managed-child primitive receives an executable, ordered arguments,
ordered environment pairs, a log label, and a touch-supervision flag. It closes
direct fbdev presentation, snapshots and restores the TTY, starts a separate
process group, polls every 40 ms, sends TERM for shutdown or the original
two-second touch hold, escalates the complete group to KILL after four seconds,
and reports started, touch, exit, signal, error, and shutdown fields. Lisp owns
the starting screen, one audio finish, control close, game/reboot dispatch,
forced control scan, presentation reopen, volume reload, final status, and fbdev
Deck-touch reconnect. Injected effect handlers retain priority. Per owner
approval, launch policy passes ROM paths directly to the established emulators
and lets them reject invalid content rather than duplicating their validation.
The network primitive reports the current `wlan0` SSID and IPv4 address, the
`wg0` IPv4 address, and the bounded Wi-Fi selector status while Lisp owns its
path, refresh timing, result shape, and rendering. One native
input poll waits on the selected Wayland or fbdev touchscreen first, then the
stable gamepad and keyboard descriptors, with one timeout. Ready controls are
read before touch; the fixed result reports queue counts, touch loss, control
rescan, and Wayland shutdown while Lisp retains mapping, arbitration, timing,
and audio quarantine. The control boundary keeps at most two exact THEGamepads
and four complete keyboards, decodes resynchronization and rising edges, and
returns raw reports for Lisp policy. The specialized terminal primitive uses the
same supervisor, accepts the exact keymap and mode boundary, restores console
state, accepts the original two-second touch return hold, and mirrors RGB565
console scanout only when the Wayland widget is
open. The fbdev path validates the device-reported 600x1280 RGB565 geometry and
stride, rotates the complete 1280x480 logical canvas in ordinary RAM, and
publishes finished rows. The Lisp runtime adapter now exposes initialization, a
single-iteration coordinator, and shutdown: Lisp reads the pre-poll clock,
runs recovery and timers, chooses the policy timeout, invokes the aggregate
native poll, dispatches the normalized snapshot, and preserves the combined
effect trace. Startup opens neither display backend automatically, so the Rust
host remains harmless beside the working C++ dashboard until Lisp rendering
reaches full parity.

Build the host and run its focused mechanism tests with:

```sh
nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#retrodeck-native
cargo test --manifest-path native/Cargo.toml --locked --lib
```

After installation, run the same ARM smoke test used during activation with:

```sh
ECLDIR=/mnt/data/nes-deck/ecl/lib/ecl/ \
  /mnt/data/nes-deck/retrodeck-native \
  /mnt/data/nes-deck/lisp/startup.lisp
```

Check that a package has no Nix runtime references before deploying it:

```sh
out=$(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths .#chiptune-deck | tail -n 1)
file "$out/bin/chiptune-deck"
test -z "$(nix-store -q --references "$out")"
```

The expected executable is a statically linked 32-bit ARM EABI5 binary.

Build and inspect the complete deployable matrix with:

```sh
tests/verify-arm-builds.sh
```

This rejects a missing executable, a non-ARM or dynamically linked binary, a
Nix store reference, an incomplete ECL or fbterm runtime, and a changed CC0
music payload. It also runs the ARM host under QEMU to exercise the embedded
ECL callbacks, including Wayland and fbdev boundaries, projected credits frames,
large elapsed times, helper stdin and process-result classification, and the
audio-worker lifecycle.

## Run the host test suite

The test runner compiles into a temporary directory and leaves the worktree
clean:

```sh
tests/run-host-tests.sh
```

It covers Lisp menu-sound policy, the Rust menu-tone renderer, NES mixer, APU
noise, SRAM codec, controller and keyboard input, dashboard geometry and
behavior, ROM catalog, cover cache, Wi-Fi profile helper, rlwrap-backed
terminal lifecycle, shared framebuffer/audio runtime, timer configuration, and
CHIP-8 core.

The suite also runs the uploader's Go tests for authentication, request
boundaries, ROM validation, atomic storage, and the Paper UI contract.

Run shell checks on deployment code with:

```sh
nix shell nixpkgs#shellcheck -c shellcheck -x \
  ops/lib/deck-config.sh ops/check-deck.sh ops/configure-deck.sh ops/deploy.sh \
  ops/deploy/activate.sh ops/provision-deck.sh \
  deploy/menu/nes-deck-swap.init \
  tests/run-host-tests.sh tests/deploy_config_test.sh \
  tests/deploy_activation_test.sh tests/check_deck_test.sh \
  tests/nes_deck_swap_test.sh \
  tests/verify-arm-builds.sh
```

## Validate language and music runtimes on a Deck

The deploy script performs basic Python, Scheme, and dashboard smoke tests
before stopping the running service. For focused checks against a staged
binary:

```sh
/mnt/data/nes-deck/langs/python -c 'print(6 * 7)'
CHIBI_MODULE_PATH=/mnt/data/nes-deck/langs/chibi/lib \
  /mnt/data/nes-deck/langs/chibi/chibi-scheme -q -p '(+ 20 22)'
/mnt/data/nes-deck/chiptune-deck --probe \
  /mnt/data/chiptunes/crazy.ogg
```

The chiptune player can render its UI without opening the framebuffer:

```sh
/mnt/data/nes-deck/chiptune-deck --render-preview \
  /mnt/data/chiptunes/crazy.ogg /tmp/chiptune-player.ppm
```

## Render dashboard screenshots

Copy the persistent cover cache from a Deck, then run the native renderer:

```sh
scp -r root@10.0.0.10:/mnt/data/nes-deck/covers /tmp/deck-covers
ops/deck-menu/render-screenshots.sh deploy/menu/games.tsv \
  /tmp/deck-covers "$HOME/retro-deck-screens"
```

The output contains every game selection, settings variants, animated and
reduced-motion FOSS credits, the Wi-Fi keyboard, reboot confirmation, timer,
and a contact sheet.

## Platform details

The Deck CPU is ARMv7 Cortex-A7 hard-float. Its panel is a portrait 600x1280
RGB565 framebuffer used as a 1280x480 logical landscape display. The physical
pitch is 1280 bytes, including 80 bytes of padding per row, and only physical
columns 0 through 479 are visible. Code must use the stride reported by
`FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO`, not `xres * bytes_per_pixel`.

The menu fills the complete 1280x480 logical surface. Emulators and the
chiptune player use the shared scaler with a 16-pixel safe inset for the
rounded display. fbterm uses a 1248x448 viewport for the same reason. Every
frontend rejects unexpected geometry or color channel layouts rather than
guessing.

On BMC compositor installations, Retro Deck is a fullscreen scene widget.
The menu submits event-driven XRGB8888 shared-memory buffers through the Deck
widget protocol, so the compositor can move it during scene swipes. A launched
game maps a fullscreen black layer surface plus a centered game layer surface.
The emulator keeps its native frame clock and submits frames independently of
the widget callback limit. The client expands gameplay frames to their
integer-scaled layer size with nearest-neighbor sampling, then the compositor
maps the resulting buffer 1:1. BMC's Smithay renderer defaults to linear
minification and magnification, which can still soften pixel boundaries during
the rotated composition pass. Apply the tracked local patch before building a
BMC image for Retro Deck:

```sh
ops/bmc/apply-local-patches.sh /root/bmc-main
nix build --no-link /root/bmc-main#deck-packages.core.pkg
```

The patch selects nearest-neighbor filtering for both directions. The script
is idempotent and refuses a source tree whose patch context does not match.
When the game exits, both layer surfaces disappear and scene swiping resumes.

`ops/deploy.sh` installs the widget under `/mnt/data/bmc-widgets/retro-deck`.
If `bmc-compositor` is present, deployment stops it, adds one idempotent Retro
Deck scene to `/etc/bmc_config.json`, disables the legacy fbdev menu service,
enables a 64 MiB swapfile before BMC starts, and restarts the compositor. The
swap is needed because 128 MiB of the Deck's 256 MiB RAM is reserved for CMA;
without it, a stock BMC widget plus Retro Deck can trigger global OOM while
the first fullscreen SHM frame is faulted in. Existing swapfiles are left
untouched if they cannot be enabled. The original configuration is retained
once as `/etc/bmc_config.json.retro-deck.bak` before the first scene edit.

Audio uses `/dev/dsp` through the Deck's ALSA OSS bridge. All streams use
signed 16-bit little-endian samples. Emulator and chiptune streams are stereo;
the menu and timer cues are mono. FCEUmm reports 48 kHz. The OSS device stays at its
required nominal 48 kHz while the runtime resamples to the measured 47,328
frames/s application clock. Fuse, CHIP-8, the timer, menu cues, and chiptunes
use 44.1 kHz. Gambatte produces 32,768 Hz and is explicitly resampled to the
Deck's verified 32 kHz OSS rate. Gain is applied in the native mixer because
the kernel OSS path bypasses ALSA userspace soft volume.

The framebuffer has no page-flip API. Frontends build complete frames in
cacheable memory and copy finished rows to fb0 to reduce tearing and protect
audio timing. `RETRO_DECK_RUNTIME_DIAGNOSTICS=1` logs 60-frame timing windows
from the shared libretro frontend.
