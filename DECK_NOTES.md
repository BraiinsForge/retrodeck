# Deck platform and runtime notes

This file is the current-state field reference for Retro Deck. It intentionally
does not preserve the chronological deployment diary, old binary hashes,
temporary backup names, or superseded experiments. Git history records those
details when they are needed for archaeology.

## Sources of truth

- `README.md` documents installation and normal use.
- `BUILD.md` documents reproducible builds, tests, and source layout.
- `deploy/menu/README.md` defines dashboard behavior and the catalog contract.
- `ops/deck-wifi/README.md` defines Wi-Fi recovery behavior.
- `ops/deck-wireguard/README.md` defines the userspace WireGuard bundle.
- `docs/swipe-rendering-postmortem.org` explains the clock swipe incident.
- `terminal/PROVENANCE.md` records the vendored fbterm sources and licenses.

## Hardware and persistent storage

- The target is an ARMv7 Cortex-A7 Braiins Forge Deck running OpenWrt.
- The unit has 256 MiB of RAM, with 128 MiB reserved for CMA on the inspected
  BMC image. A 64 MiB swapfile starts after `/mnt/data` is mounted so a stock
  widget and Retro Deck can coexist without an avoidable global OOM kill.
- `/mnt/data` is the persistent application volume. Deployment refuses to
  activate when that mount is absent.
- Locally staged ROMs install under `/mnt/data/roms/<system>/`. The systems are
  `nes`, `gb`, `gbc`, `gba`, and `zx`.
- Language working directories live under `/mnt/data/langs/`. Chiptunes live
  under `/mnt/data/chiptunes`.
- Runtime state, logs, covers, licenses, and launchers live under
  `/mnt/data/nes-deck`.

## Display and presentation

- The panel framebuffer is 600 by 1280 RGB565 with a reported 1280-byte pitch.
  Each physical row therefore includes 80 padding bytes. Code must use the
  reported stride, not `xres * bytes-per-pixel`.
- The panel is portrait hardware used as a 1280 by 480 logical landscape
  display. The fbdev fallback rotates pixels in software.
- The touchscreen already reports logical landscape coordinates from X
  0 through 1279 and Y 0 through 479. No touch rotation is needed.
- Native content uses a 16-pixel safe inset for the rounded panel corners.
  fbterm uses a 1248 by 448 viewport for the same reason.
- On BMC, the dashboard mirrors fbterm's rotated framebuffer into its existing
  Wayland widget surface; fbterm keeps tty1 keyboard input and its fixed font.
- With BMC installed, the dashboard is a full-screen swipeable widget. Games
  use a full-screen black layer-shell surface plus a centered game surface.
  Those temporary surfaces disappear when the game exits, restoring scene
  swiping.
- Emulators expand source pixels to the integer-scaled layer buffer before
  submitting it. `patches/bmc-nearest-neighbor-filter.patch` also selects
  nearest-neighbor minification and magnification in Smithay. Apply it with
  `ops/bmc/apply-local-patches.sh` before building the BMC core.
- The menu disables Linux console blanking whenever it starts and unblanks the
  framebuffer after a child returns. The display should never time out while
  Retro Deck is active.

## Dashboard and programs

- `deploy/menu/games.sexp` is the editable catalog. The compiler produces
  `games.tsv` and `palette.tsv`; checked-in copies are tested byte for byte as
  fallbacks.
- Owner-maintained console entries point only below `/mnt/data/roms/<system>/`.
  Deck-native routing identifiers stay below `/mnt/data/nes-deck/games/` and do
  not need a fictional file extension.
- Terminal, Lua, Common Lisp, Python, Scheme, chiptunes, and reboot are native
  built-in entries added by the dashboard. They are not ROMs.
- The dashboard palette uses full RGB semantic roles. A malformed persistent
  override cannot prevent startup; the launcher falls back through the last
  valid generated palette, the checked-in palette, and built-in defaults.
- Settings icons include twelve native pixel cogs and 36 CC0 Knekko cogs.
  The selected icon is stored in the same appearance override as the colors.
- The bottom-left `(c)` control opens an animated FOSS credits crawl from
  `deploy/menu/credits.tsv`. Its fixed-size source text is projected onto one
  continuously receding plane instead of changing between discrete font
  scales. B or its top-right close control returns to the dashboard. Installed
  license texts live under
  `/mnt/data/nes-deck/licenses`.

## Emulators and media

| System | Core | Source geometry | Nominal frame rate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| NES | FCEUmm | 256 by 224 after vertical overscan crop | 60.100 Hz |
| GB and GBC | Gambatte | 160 by 144 | 59.728 Hz |
| GBA | gpSP | 240 by 160 | 59.728 Hz |
| ZX Spectrum | Fuse | 320 by 240 core output | 50 Hz |
| DOOM | fbDOOM | 320 by 200 | 35 Hz (DOOM's tic rate) |

- NES renders at exact 2x scale as 512 by 448 inside the safe area.
- DOOM renders at exact 2x scale as 640 by 400 inside the safe area, so the
  panel keeps black margins left and right. The engine's renderer is fixed at
  320 by 200; nothing widescreen is available without changing DOOM's own
  resolution assumptions.
- DOOM's own framebuffer, rotation, and BGR565 patches are unused. Its
  platform layer lives in `native/doom/` and hands finished frames to the
  same scaler and presentation paths as the emulators, so it works on the
  BMC compositor as well as the framebuffer fallback.
- DOOM audio is one 44.1 kHz stereo stream: sound effects are point-resampled
  from their original 11 kHz DMX lumps and summed on top of the emulated OPL
  music.
- OPL music is on and holds a flat 35.0 fps with no shed frames at the full
  44100 Hz, indistinguishable from running with no music at all. Two things
  had to be true for that.
- The emulator choice. Chocolate Doom's later Nuked OPL3 always emulates at
  49716 Hz internally whatever output rate it is handed, so it costs about 80%
  of a core and does not tune down: dropping its rate from 22050 to 8000 Hz
  changed nothing measurable, which is what exposed the fixed internal rate.
  DOSBox's dbopl, from Chocolate Doom 2.2.1, runs at the rate it is given.
- The clock. The driver advances emulated time per *consumed* chip frame, not
  per generated batch. Advancing per batch lets a caller consume frames
  already in hand while the clock stands still, which stalls the timers the
  chip-detection handshake reads back: detection failed, DOOM discarded the
  music module, and nothing played. Watch for `OPL_Init: Using driver` in the
  log, and note that an uninitialised chip emits enough noise to make a
  naive "did any sample come out" check pass while no song is playing.
- fbDOOM never calls `OPL_InitRegisters`, so the driver performs that
  initialisation itself. Nuked sounded regardless; dbopl stays silent without
  the waveform-enable write.
- `RETRO_DECK_DOOM_MUSIC=0` disables music; `RETRO_DECK_DOOM_MUSIC_RATE`
  emulates the chip below the output rate and upsamples. Neither is needed.
- Shedding a present only helps when presentation is what made a frame late.
  DOOM never sheds twice in a row, because when the cost is elsewhere the
  lateness never recovers and an unconditional rule sheds nearly every frame,
  freezing the picture while the engine still runs at rate. That was the
  original "lag spike" symptom, and it is why frame rate alone is a
  misleading measure here; the shed count is the one to watch.
- The chiptune player supports GME formats and 44.1 kHz mono or stereo Ogg
  Vorbis. It does not recurse without bounds or follow symbolic links.
- Console emulators display a top-left exit cross. Holding anywhere for two
  seconds terminates the supervised child and returns to the dashboard.

## Controllers and keyboards

- Identical Retro Games THEGamepad controllers are ordered by stable physical
  USB path. Keep them in the same hub ports to preserve Player 1 and Player 2.
- A/X maps to the primary console button. B/Y maps to the secondary button.
  Start maps to Start and Back maps to Select.
- A keyboard fallback maps arrows or WASD to the D-pad, Space to A, Shift to B,
  Enter to Start, and Control to Select.
- ZX Spectrum uses Kempston for Player 1 and Sinclair 2 for Player 2. A/X fires,
  L is Enter, and R is Space. A physical keyboard is passed through to Fuse as
  a Spectrum keyboard instead of being reduced to console controls.
- The dashboard grabs controllers and keyboards only while it is visible. It
  releases them before starting a managed child, then rescans after the child
  exits.

## Audio and saves

- The Deck exposes `/dev/dsp` through its ALSA OSS bridge. The runtime treats
  audio failure as non-fatal so video and input remain usable.
- Menu volume is stored from 0 through 100 in five-point steps and is passed to
  every child. Muting remembers the last audible level.
- FCEUmm reports 48 kHz. The OSS device remains configured at its required
  nominal 48 kHz while the runtime resamples to the measured 47,328-frame
  application clock to avoid slowing emulation.
- Gambatte produces 32,768 Hz and is resampled to the Deck's verified 32 kHz
  OSS rate.
- NES battery RAM is saved atomically beside the ROM as `.srm`. GB, GBC, and
  GBA use `.sav`, plus `.rtc` when the cartridge exposes a real-time clock.
  Deployment merges ROM directories and preserves these sidecars.
- gpSP looks for the official `gba_bios.bin` beside the ROMs in
  `/mnt/data/roms/gba/` (never committed, never uploadable) and logs which
  BIOS it uses; without the file it falls back to its built-in HLE BIOS with
  reduced compatibility. The dynarec is enabled; frameskip is off.
- ZX TAP files are read-only tape media and have no automatic save sidecar.

## Terminal

- The terminal is an integrated static fbterm fork, not an external release
  copied onto the Deck by hand.
- It uses DejaVu Sans Mono, fixed glyph advances, RGB565 channel order, the
  rounded-corner viewport, and the active `/dev/tty1` console.
- The dashboard toggles between US ANSI and Czech QWERTZ keymaps. The launcher
  restores US after fbterm exits.
- The shell mode starts `/bin/ash`. Lua, ECL, MicroPython, and Chibi Scheme
  start in private persistent language directories. ECL uses `rlwrap` and a
  private persistent history file.

## Networking

- Wi-Fi profile writes and Wi-Fi selection are deliberately separate. The
  dashboard writes a validated mode-0600 PSK profile through stdin and never
  scans, reloads, roams, or disconnects the current network.
- The watcher requires association, a `wlan0` IPv4 address, and a default route
  before declaring the connection healthy. It waits through a 90-second boot
  grace and two failed health observations before asking the selector to act.
- Selection is bounded and transactional. It tries saved profiles, restores the
  immediate UCI backup when all candidates fail, and never waits forever after
  rollback.
- The status file contains no credentials. The settings screen shows its state,
  the active SSID, the WLAN address, and the WireGuard address.
- The uploader listens on every IPv4 interface at port 8080. Its password comes
  from the private per-Deck configuration and is never committed.
- WireGuard uses the checked-in ABI-matched TUN module plus userspace
  `wireguard-go`. Each Deck owns a unique private key generated on that Deck and
  a unique `10.0.0.x/32` address.

## Services and deployment

- In BMC mode, `/etc/init.d/bmc-compositor` owns the display and spawns the
  Retro Deck widget. The legacy fbdev `nes-deck` service remains disabled.
- Without BMC, `/etc/init.d/nes-deck` supervises the fbdev launcher directly.
- `/etc/init.d/nes-deck-uploader`, `/etc/init.d/deck-wifi`, and
  `/etc/init.d/deck-wireguard` are independent services.
- `ops/deploy.sh` builds a complete static ARM payload and uploads it to a
  private staging directory. `ops/deploy/activate.sh` validates that tree before
  stopping services, installs it, and attempts to restart stopped services if
  activation fails.
- Application deployment does not edit Wi-Fi. Initial provisioning performs
  guarded Wi-Fi and WireGuard setup before calling the same application
  deployer.

## Current physical acceptance items

The 2026-07-18 `.15` deployment passed host tests, ARM builds, staged
validation, ECL catalog generation, service checks, and process-path checks.
Three observations still require eyes and ears on the physical unit:

1. Compare NES pixel edges after the nearest-neighbor compositor patch.
2. Listen to Kirby and Micro Mages long enough to assess the reported NES audio
   distortion rather than only their title screens.
3. Start a ZX title with the rebuilt valid-memfd frontend and confirm its first
   playable frame.

These are explicit acceptance checks, not claims that unobserved behavior has
already been verified.
