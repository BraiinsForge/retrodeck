# ROM intake web server

The native `rom-uploader` service accepts owner-supplied ROMs at the Deck's
active Wi-Fi or WireGuard IPv4 address on port 8080. Deployment writes
`0.0.0.0:8080` to `/mnt/data/nes-deck/uploader/address.conf`, so the listener
accepts connections on every IPv4 interface. Requests must use an IPv4 or
IPv4-mapped literal host on port 8080, and form origins must match that exact
address.

The service uses a PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 password record, bounded login attempts,
eight-hour same-site sessions, CSRF tokens, strict origin and host checks, and
a 12 MiB request ceiling. It validates raw ROMs or a ZIP containing exactly
one matching ROM. Existing files are never replaced. Successful files go to
`/mnt/data/roms/<system>/`, and the private supplemental catalog is written
atomically to `/mnt/data/nes-deck/uploads/games.tsv` before the dashboard is
restarted.

The authenticated page also edits all semantic dashboard colors as full
`#RRGGBB` values. It writes one complete, strictly validated version-2
S-expression to `/mnt/data/nes-deck/state/dashboard-palette.sexp` and restarts
the dashboard. Existing version-3 overrides remain readable: their colors are
preserved and their retired settings-icon choice is ignored. Built-in defaults
remain available when the optional override is malformed.

The Go service remains authoritative. Startup-loaded `lisp/policy.lisp` now
exposes a non-authoritative copy of its editable HTTP, authentication, ROM,
catalog, palette, persistence, system, color, label, and restart policy. Focused
tests pin that snapshot to the current Go sources. Lisp also exposes an opt-in
palette save plan that accepts decoded color fields, rejects unknown, repeated,
missing, or malformed values with the existing response policy, normalizes RGB
to uppercase, emits the exact version-2 override bytes, and returns the private
atomic-write and timed dashboard-restart contract. This does not change the Go
server, dashboard, launcher, or `RETRODECK:MAIN`.

`ops/configure-deck.sh` asks for the uploader password during setup and stores
it in the local, Git-ignored `deck.conf` with mode `0600`. Each deployment
derives a fresh password record and installs only that record at
`/mnt/data/nes-deck/uploader/password.conf`; the clear password is not retained
on the Deck. Change the local configuration and deploy again to rotate it.

To replace it directly without placing the value in argv or shell history,
run this from a trusted machine:

```sh
read -rsp 'New ROM uploader password: ' password
printf '\n'
printf '%s\n' "$password" |
  ssh root@10.0.0.10 \
    '/mnt/data/nes-deck/uploader/rom-uploader --set-password /mnt/data/nes-deck/uploader/password.conf && /etc/init.d/nes-deck-uploader restart'
unset password
```

Eight bytes are accepted for a Deck that remains in a trusted location. Use at
least 16 bytes for a Deck that may leave one. The service never changes Wi-Fi,
WireGuard, routes, or firewall rules.
